#Decennial-Census
Every ten years, as mandated by the Constitution, the U.S. Census counts every resident in the United States. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and the USG uses these statistics to distribute billions in federal funds to states and communities. The Census API provides population data by sex, age, and race, as well as housing data by occupancy, vacancy status, and tenure, at all levels of geographic resolution. http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census-data.html

Example use case: Build a tool that allows nonprofits to better target their services based on demographic characteristics of neighborhoods.
