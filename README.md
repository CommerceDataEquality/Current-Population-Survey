# Decennial-Census
Every ten years, as mandated by the Constitution, the U.S. Census counts every resident in the United States. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and the USG uses these statistics to distribute billions in federal funds to states and communities. The Census API provides population data by sex, age, and race, as well as housing data by occupancy, vacancy status, and tenure, at all levels of geographic resolution. http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census-data.html

Example use case: Build a tool that allows nonprofits to better target their services based on demographic characteristics of neighborhoods.

# American-Community-Survey
The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides vital information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people. Through the ACS, we know more about jobs and occupations, educational attainment, veterans, whether people own or rent their home, and other topics.

# Current-Population-Survey
The Current Population Survey (CPS) is one of the oldest, largest, and most well-recognized surveys in the United States. In addition to being the primary source of monthly labor force statistics, the CPS is used to collect data for a variety of other studies that keep the nation informed of the economic and social well-being of its people.

# Making-Income-Data-Available-as-a-Service
The MIDAAS API combines data from the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is designed to encourage a broader understanding of income inequality. This API returns incomes of different percentiles for the overall population over various geographies. In addition, you can make calls for different subsets of the population based on race, sex, and age groups. https://midaas.commerce.gov/developers/

Use case example: Use data from the MIDAAS API to develop guidance for a local government on where to target interventions on pay inequality, based on specific zipcodes, industries, or demographic groups. 

# Census Geocoder (API)
The Census Geocoder is an address lookup tool that converts an address to an lat/long coordinate and returns information about the address range and the census geography the address is within. The geocoder is available as a web interface and as an API.

# Health Insurance Statistics
This API combines datasets from the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement, Survey of Income and Program Participation, American Community Survey and Small Area Health Insurance Estimates to provide a comprehensive view of how health care coverage over time and by region is changing in the US.

# Survey of Income and Program Participation
The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a source of data on the interaction between tax, transfer, and other government and private policies. SIPP collects information for assistance received either directly as money or indirectly as in-kind benefits and SIPP data provide the most extensive information available on how the nation's economic well-being changes over time.
